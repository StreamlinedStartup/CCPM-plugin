# CCPM Changelog

## [2.0.0] - Plugin Architecture Release

### üéØ Overview
**Major architectural upgrade**: CCPM is now a Claude Code Plugin! This release transforms CCPM from a template system into a modern plugin that installs once and works across all projects. Includes automatic migration tooling and backwards compatibility.

### üöÄ Breaking Changes
- **Plugin Architecture**: System now distributed as Claude Code Plugin instead of copied template
- **Installation Method**: Changed from `curl | bash` to `/plugin install ccpm@automazeio`
- **File Organization**: Commands, agents, rules, scripts now in plugin; only user data (PRDs, epics, context) in project

### ‚ú® Added
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**: Plugin manifest with metadata and configuration
- **Plugin Path References**: All internal paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable
- **`/migrate-from-template` command**: Automated migration from v1.x template to v2.0 plugin
- **Migration script** (`scripts/migrate-to-plugin.sh`): Standalone migration utility
- **Self-hosted marketplace** (`marketplace/marketplace.json`): Plugin distribution infrastructure
- **MIGRATION.md**: Comprehensive migration guide for existing users
- **Plugin installation docs**: Updated README with plugin-first installation

### üîÑ Changed
- **Command references**: Updated 14 PM commands to use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/ccpm/scripts/...`
- **Rule references**: Updated 20+ files to use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/ccpm/rules/...`
- **Agent references**: Updated test-runner agent to use plugin paths
- **Init command**: Modified to create project directories instead of copying template files
- **README.md**: Prioritizes plugin installation, moves manual installation to advanced section
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated to reflect plugin architecture
- **Repository structure**: Kept `ccpm/` directory for plugin contents

### üõ†Ô∏è Migration Path
**For existing users (v1.x template)**:
1. Run `/migrate-from-template` in your project
2. Or manually remove `.claude/{commands,agents,rules,scripts}`
3. Keep `.claude/{prds,epics,context}` (your data)
4. Install plugin: `/plugin install ccpm@automazeio`

**For new users**:
1. Install plugin: `/plugin install ccpm@automazeio`
2. Initialize project: `/pm:init`
3. Create context: `/context:create`

### üì¶ Benefits
- ‚úÖ Single installation for all projects
- ‚úÖ Easy updates via `/plugin update ccpm`
- ‚úÖ Cleaner project structure
- ‚úÖ Version management with rollback
- ‚úÖ Marketplace distribution

### üîß Technical Details
- Plugin paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable
- User data remains in project's `.claude/` directory
- Commands, agents, rules, scripts provided by global plugin installation
- Backwards compatible: Manual installation still supported

### üìö Documentation
- Added `MIGRATION.md` - Complete migration guide
- Added `marketplace/README.md` - Marketplace setup guide
- Updated main `README.md` - Plugin-first approach
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` - Plugin architecture details
